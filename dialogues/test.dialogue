My parents took this picture right after I was born.
They said that I was the best thing to ever happen to them.
At the time, I'm sure they believed that was true.

Mom has always been an outdoorsy person.
I don't remember it, but this proves she used to take me out on her walks.
I still wonder what she thought about during them.

Dad has always been the big thinker. The intellectual.
We'd build blocks together. He'd say he was "training me to become an architect".
I think I might have thought that I wanted to become one once. I don't know.

Thinking back to high school graduation is bittersweet.
My family never felt closer.
I didn't appreciate then how beautiful that is.

I remember the moment I took this photo. I snuck around a corner to do it.
My parents were fighting about something I didn't understand - then or now.
I knew they didn't want me to see, but I looked on anyway.

Mom took this picture when she took me fishing.
She spent a lot of time complaining about Dad.
I spent a lot of time trying to catch a fish.

Dad took this picture while we were working on crosswords.
He always encouraged me to do them. Said they were "mind expansive".
Given how expansive his mind was, I guess Mom's corner of it was smaller - proportionally.

I was alone for my college graduation. My friend took this picture.
Mom couldn't stomach the thought of Dad potentially being there, and vice versa.
So as a compromise...neither came.
I know parents are humans. We don't think they are when we're kids, but they are.
They have their own human problems, sometimes with each other.
But it's hard not to think about the endless "what ifs"...
Maybe it was our fault. Maybe it wasn't. Either way, ultimately their life is theirs.
And our life is ours.
